# MeruTest
The project NumberTest has the solution for the 1st question and the project MeruTest has the solution for the second question.

=========================== QUESTIONS ==============================

Q1 - If given a set of integers, perform following tasks to it:-

1. Identify the series of numbers in ascending order from the given set, and find their sum.
2. Print the heighest SUM of all along with its entire series.

For Example:

{1,6,8,3,6,12,1,2,4,2,7,9,12,3,1,6,7,10,11}

Series which are in ascending order and sum:-
1,6,8 = 15
3,6,12 = 21
1,2,4 = 7
2,7,9,12 = 30
1,6,7,10,11 = 35

Series with highest SUM : 1,6,7,10,11 = 35.

Q2 - This question requires you to understand the requirement and make use of Entity framework and WebAPI to get the output.

Create 4 tables in your local DB

Customer(CustId,CustName,CustMobNo,Address,SubAreaId ), 
City(CityId,CityName,State),
Area(AreaId,AreaName,CityId),
SubArea(SubAreaId,SubAreaName,AreaId)

Write a program to fetch following details, SubAreaName, AreaName, CityName, CustomerName, Address based on customermobileno. using a single LINQ/LAMBDA Expression query
